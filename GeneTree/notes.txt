//this files contains some of the ongoing notes.  things in here should be cleared out and made into Issues or just implemented.

need to take a first shot at the BNP data with a new configuration and test load

consider letting the less than test pick a value instead of doing min/max test

normalize doubledatacolumn results

track score over time for different generations and plot the results (look for when/where they top out)

new trees should be allowed to make genetic changes without having to survive first... get some more randomness into things

might be good to look for low performing nodes and make changes to them (could just NO CLASS to get rid of bad ones)

do some analysis to determine which data columns are showing up most frequently for analysis
 - continue this to see which columns do best for predicting which class?

need to check for instances where the same test shows up below a node in the tree
 - this also occurs when both terminal nodes point to the same thing

need to see which generated features show up in the tree... keep those and generate more (GA for features almost)

need a quick way to remove features from the data (ideally w/o removing original data)

determine why the NO CLASS is not getting used as before (problem with percent classed)?

only compute calcualtedcolumns on the test data... save the formula to use for other values as needed

possible to group categories since the data is ordinal?  maybe not useful now, but good to remember

recreate the delete node option (force class to NO CLASS)

default to the BNP data

go to 3 digits on doubles by default (outputs)
