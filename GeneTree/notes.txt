//this files contains some of the ongoing notes.  things in here should be cleared out and made into Issues or just implemented.

need to take a first shot at the BNP data with a new configuration and test load

consider letting the less than test pick a value instead of doing min/max test

normalize doubledatacolumn results

track score over time for different generations and plot the results (look for when/where they top out)

new trees should be allowed to make genetic changes without having to survive first... get some more randomness into things

might be good to look for low performing nodes and make changes to them (could just NO CLASS to get rid of bad ones)

do some analysis to determine which data columns are showing up most frequently for analysis
 - continue this to see which columns do best for predicting which class?

get an output of categories to look into feature engineering options
