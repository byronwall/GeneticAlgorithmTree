//this files contains some of the ongoing notes.  things in here should be cleared out and made into Issues or just implemented.

need to take a first shot at the BNP data with a new configuration and test load

allow the split node to select more than just the most traversed node... some sort of prob based on traverse maybe

need some output to indicate where in the sequence things are

avoid sending things through twice

swap is doing the best to help trees out... improve it with better node selection (not random)
